    "Last Observation Carried Forward (LOCF): Use the last observed value for a participant to fill in missing data.\n",

    "Linear Interpolation: Estimate missing values based on linear trends between observed data points.\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiple Imputation: Generate multiple complete datasets with imputed values, perform analyses on each dataset, and combine results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consequences: Imputation methods can retain sample size and preserve statistical power. However, they assume that the missing data are missing at random (MAR) and may introduce bias if this assumption is violated. The choice of imputation method can also affect the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mixed-Model Analysis (Linear Mixed Effects Models): This approach is a robust method for handling missing data in repeated measures ANOVA. Mixed models account for both within-subject correlations and varying numbers of observations per subject.\n",
