    "APIs define the methode and data format that application can use to request and exchange information.\n",
    "\n",
    "An example of API usage in real life is when you use a mobile application to book a ride with a ridesharing service like Uber or Lyft. The mobile app communicates with the ridesharing service's API to send a request for a ride. The API then processes the request, checks for available drivers, calculates the fare, and sends back the response to the mobile app with the details of the assigned driver, estimated arrival time, and fare information. The mobile app uses the data received from the API to display the necessary information to the user."

    "Advantages:-\n",
    "1. Modularity and Scalability :- APIs allow developers to break down complex systems into smaller, modular components. This promotes scalability, as different components can be developed and updated independently, \n",
    "                                 making it easier to add new features or expand functionality.\n",
    "2. Reusability and Efficiency :- APIs provide a standardized way to access and reuse functionality across different applications. Developers can leverage existing APIs to save time and effort,\n",
    "3. Integration  :- APIs enable different software systems to communicate and share data seamlessly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Disadvantage:-\n",
    "1. Complexity :-  Working with APIs requires understanding their documentation, endpoints, parameters, and authentication mechanisms.\n",
    "2. Dependency and Reliability:- When applications rely heavily on external APIs, their functionality and performance can be impacted if the API experiences downtime or changes in its specifications.\n",
    "3. Security and Privacy Risks:- APIs can be vulnerable to security threats if not properly secured."
